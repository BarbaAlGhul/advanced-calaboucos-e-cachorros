# Advanced Calabouços & Cachorros [WIP]
Advanced Calabouços & Cachorros (Advanced Dungeons & Dogs in English) is a roguelike game in development, using python and the libtcod library.

This is an advanced version of the first game(that was actually a prototype), which uses [python-tcod
](https://github.com/libtcod/python-tcod) 11.3.0 and Python 3.7.4

This code is totally based on the [Roguelike Tutorial Revised](http://rogueliketutorials.com/)
